## **Overview**

This project serves as a **Junior Frontend Developer** recruitment task for [byss](https://byss.pl/). It is a simple web application for managing events with two calendars. Events can be moved between calendars with drag-and-drop motion. The app allows for multiple events handling. Full CRUD functionality is implemented with client-side-only mockup data.

The app is fully responsive and was tested on different screen sizes.

Drag and drop functionality is only available for mouse movement. To move events on touch screens users must edit the date in the edit form.

### Production

The production version can be found [here](https://deluxe-trifle-050594.netlify.app/).
